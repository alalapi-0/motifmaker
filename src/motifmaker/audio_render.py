"""Audio render router integrating the mix stage with an AI-ready endpoint.

This module intentionally keeps the MIDI rendering pipeline untouched while
exposing a dedicated entry point for waveform generation. The implementation is
currently a stub that mimics an external AI service. Future work can swap the
stub with real providers such as MusicGen, AudioLDM or a proprietary model.
